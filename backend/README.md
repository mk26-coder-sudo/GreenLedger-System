# 📌 What We Have Built

* 📊 **Zone Scoring System**
  Calculates environmental score using NDVI, population, heat, and flood risk

* 🌳 **Optimization Engine**
  Selects top zones and allocates saplings using heap-based logic

* 🔁 **Impact Simulation**
  Uses BFS to simulate how plantation affects nearby zones

* 📉 **Before vs After Analysis**
  Shows score reduction and overall impact after planting

---

# 🔗 Key APIs

* `GET /zones` → Get all zones
* `GET /optimize?k=3` → Get best zones + allocation
* `POST /plant` → Apply plantation and see impact
